import UIKit

class MyCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {

    @IBOutlet weak var myLabel: UILabel!
    
    // let each label say something different for the different months, and customizw the colors
    // how would you get to the indivigual cell
    // would you be able to click on a cell and have the whole calendar for the month apear
    // i think i'm going to have to make a collection view inside of a collection view, and then have it go to a coco touch class once the date is selected and then once it is selected you can press a button so that an alert will pop up and you can enter the information into a tabel view
